# Name the command that determines the state of the SSH service.

# SSH provides password or public-key based authentication and
# encrypts connections between two network endpoints.
# In addition to providing strong encryption,
# SSH is widely used by network administrators to manage systems and
# applications remotely, deliver software patches, or
# execute commands and move files.
